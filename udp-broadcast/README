In this example,

* The server send message to multiple clients via broadcast with diagram socket, 
  i.e. UDP protocol.
* In server, to enable broadcast ability of socket (defualt is disable), we need
  to call `setsockopt` to set the flag `SO_BROADCAST = 1` of `sockfd`.
* In clients, multiple clients should wait (listen) on same `BROADCAST_PORT`,
  we need to call `setsockopt` to set `SO_REUSEADDR = 1` of `sockfd`. So multiple
  different `sockfd` can be bound to same port (i.e. same address).
